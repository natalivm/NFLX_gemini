  strategicNarrative:
    "Astera is building the connectivity control plane for AI scale-up — not GPUs, not memory, but the fabric layer between them. " +
    "$6.5B Amazon warrant + Scorpio X (2027 volume ramp) + protocol-agnostic positioning (UALink + NVLink Fusion) make the bull case structural, not just cyclical. " +
    "The problem: revenue decelerating fast (85% 3Y CAGR → +8% by 2028E), margins peak 2029E then compress, and at ~53x forward P/E the market already prices the optimistic path. " +
    "If Scorpio X becomes standard in 2–3 hyperscalers, this transitions from cycle play to architectural moat (type B → A). If not, it's another AI silicon story with a semiconductor downturn ahead. " +
    "35–40% probability of 15%+ CAGR — a tactical bet on AI infrastructure positioning, not a compounder.",

    'The AI capex cycle peaks early and a semiconductor downturn hits by 2028. Scorpio X is delayed or displaced by competing solutions from NVLink and ESUN. ' +
      'Hyperscalers begin internalizing their connectivity, and the operating expense step-up compresses margins without generating payback. ' +
      'Operating leverage works in reverse with earnings falling 30-40%, and the multiple compresses to 20x as the growth premium evaporates.',
    'AI infrastructure spending sustains at moderate levels through 2028. Scorpio X ramps on schedule in 2027 with two to three hyperscaler customers. ' +
      'UALink adoption provides meaningful protocol diversification, and operating margins expand to around 45%. ' +
      'Revenue growth decelerates naturally from the high-30s toward single digits as the business matures. ' +
      'Earnings compound at roughly 27% annually, though from current valuation the stock return is more modest at 7-8% annualized.',
    'The AI supercycle extends and Scorpio X becomes the standard scale-up switching layer across major hyperscalers. ' +
      'Optical products ramp in 2028 and UALink adoption accelerates broadly. The company transitions from a cyclical play to an architectural infrastructure layer. ' +
      'Operating margins reach 50% as multi-protocol optionality across CXL, UALink, and NVLink Fusion captures an expanding market. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 35% annually, delivering 17-18% annualized stock returns.',

    'AI scale-up protocol shifts away from merchant silicon. NVLink/ESUN displaces PCIe/CXL path. ' +
      'Hyperscalers build internal connectivity (like Google TPU interconnect). ' +
      'Aggressive OpEx step-up eats into margins during cycle downturn. ' +
      '$6.5B Amazon warrant is a ceiling, not a floor — concentrated customer risk. ' +
      'RS 60 reflects market scepticism. Semiconductor cycle hits 2028-2029.',
    'Amazon warrant secures strategic position. Scorpio X ramp validates scale-up switching TAM. ' +
      'PCIe 6 first-to-volume advantage holds. Software-defined fabric creates stickiness. ' +
      'AI capex sustains but growth decelerates naturally. EBIT margin expansion to 45% offsets revenue slowdown. ' +
      'Company remains cyclical growth (type B) with improving moat. RS stays mediocre but fundamentals deliver.',
    'Scorpio X + optical + UALink = triple growth engine. Company becomes the architectural connectivity layer ' +
      'for AI scale-up infrastructure. 2-3 hyperscaler adoption creates switching costs approaching SaaS levels. ' +
      'TAM expansion from $25B to $50B+ with optical. Moat transitions from technical to structural. ' +
      'Type B → Type A reclassification. Market cap re-rates as "AI fabric infrastructure platform".',
