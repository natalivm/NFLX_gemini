  strategicNarrative:
    "Astera is building the connectivity control plane for AI scale-up — not GPUs, not memory, but the fabric layer between them. " +
    "$6.5B Amazon warrant + Scorpio X (2027 volume ramp) + protocol-agnostic positioning (UALink + NVLink Fusion) make the bull case structural, not just cyclical. " +
    "The problem: revenue decelerating fast (85% 3Y CAGR → +8% by 2028E), margins peak 2029E then compress, and at ~53x forward P/E the market already prices the optimistic path. " +
    "If Scorpio X becomes standard in 2–3 hyperscalers, this transitions from cycle play to architectural moat (type B → A). If not, it's another AI silicon story with a semiconductor downturn ahead. " +
    "35–40% probability of 15%+ CAGR — a tactical bet on AI infrastructure positioning, not a compounder.",
