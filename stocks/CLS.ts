  strategicNarrative:
    "Celestica is a top-tier EMS play on AI infrastructure — 800G/1.6T rack-level solutions for hyperscalers, FY25 adj EPS $7.16 (+56%), guiding $8.75 for FY26 (+22%). " +
    "Unprecedented demand visibility into 2027-28 with 1.6T switching platform win at a third hyperscaler. " +
    "The tension: $1B CapEx in FY26 temporarily depresses FCF while earnings power accelerates — DCF undervalues this profile, so we use EPS × P/E. " +
    "At ~41x trailing P/E, the stock prices in strong execution; risk is 63% top-3 client concentration and CapEx cycle duration. " +
    "RS 94 confirms momentum. Risk/reward is balanced — upside if AI supercycle extends, but multiple compression risk if growth decelerates.",
