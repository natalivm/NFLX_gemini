  strategicNarrative: "Arista is the pure-play backbone of the AI cluster with an EOS moat and hyperscaler lock-in. FY26 guided at $11.25B (+25% YoY) with AI networking at $3.25B. Quality is undeniable — 47% FCF margin, zero debt, strong campus diversification. The key risk is valuation: at ~49x trailing P/E, even base-case EPS growth gets offset by P/E compression to 30x, leaving 3-year returns essentially flat. Need bull-case execution or sustained premium multiple for meaningful returns.",
