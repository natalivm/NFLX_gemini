    'Brazil macro shock triggers delinquency spike past 7-8% — 4 consecutive quarters of NPL improvement reverse sharply. SELIC holding high combined with Brazil corporate tax rate hike to 45% compress net income. Mexico banking license delayed, blocking credit scale-up. 2026 investment year costs hit without revenue payback. Multiple re-rates to traditional EM bank comps (10-12x P/E).',
    'Q4 2025 momentum (ROE 33%, NPLs improving, efficiency <20%) sustains into 2026 despite investment year headwinds. nuFormer AI rolls out to lending and Mexico credit cards, moderately improving risk-adjusted NIM. Mexico LDR scales after banking license clears. ARPAC continues growing as super-core and high-income segments deepen. US charter provides optionality without near-term P&L contribution. Sustainable 25-28% EPS compounding.',
    'nuFormer AI proves structurally transformative across all geographies — $29B unused credit limit pool converts to IBB at meaningfully lower loss rates, driving ARPAC beyond $20+. Mexico banking license clears, LDR expands rapidly to rival Brazil. Super-core growing 100% YoY compounds into material P&L. US fintech launch captures a profitable niche. ROE sustains 35%+, P/E re-rates toward premium global digital bank comps. NU graduates to undisputed type A structural compounder.',
