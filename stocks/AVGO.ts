  strategicNarrative: "The debate has moved from 'will growth happen?' to 'how much multiple for 22.8% EPS CAGR at $1.6T scale?' $73B AI backlog provides 18-month visibility. Q1 AI revenue +100% YoY. VMware adds $20B+ in sticky recurring software. Street numbers are now order-book validated — the biggest risk is exit multiple, not execution.",

      'The P/E naturally compresses from 32x toward 18x through earnings growth alone — returns are driven by fundamental execution, not multiple expansion.',

      'justifies a sustained premium multiple. This is the scenario where Broadcom becomes the dominant AI infrastructure platform.',
