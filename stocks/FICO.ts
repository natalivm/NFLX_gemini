  strategicNarrative: "Structural compounder with cyclical tailwind. Q1 FY26 delivered best Scores quarter on record (+29% to $305M), Platform ARR +33%, NRR 122%, ACV bookings +36%, and mortgage revenue +60% — broad-based beat validating the platform transition. RS 17 reflects technical weakness amid broader market rotation, but fundamental/technical divergence creates asymmetric entry for conviction holders. Prob-weighted 5yr target ~$2,807 → 15.8% CAGR at $1,350 entry. Key risks: mortgage cycle reversal, regulatory changes, pricing pressure.",
