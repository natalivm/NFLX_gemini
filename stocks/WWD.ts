  strategicNarrative:
    "Post FY26 Q1 — monster quarter: +29% YoY revenue, 23.4% aero segment margin (+420 bps), " +
    "industrial margin +410 bps. FY26 guidance raised: 14–18% sales growth, EPS $8.20–$8.60 (mid $8.40), " +
    "FCF $300–350M. RS 95 confirms elite relative strength. China on-highway wind-down ($20–25M cost, " +
    "~$60M rev exiting) is a portfolio quality upgrade. Key watch: FCF conversion remains constrained by " +
    "inventory build and rising capex (Spartanburg + automation); Q1 tailwinds (spare LRUs, China " +
    "pull-forward) unlikely to repeat. At ~47x fwd P/E the stock is priced for near-perfect execution — " +
    "great business, expensive entry. Prob-weighted 15%+ CAGR from current levels: ~30%.",
