  strategicNarrative:
    "Woodward is an aerospace & industrial controls compounder coming off a monster Q1 — revenue +29%, aero margin +420bps to 23.4%, FY26 guide raised to 14-18% sales growth and $8.20-$8.60 EPS. " +
    "China on-highway wind-down ($60M revenue exiting) is actually a portfolio quality upgrade, and RS 95 confirms elite relative strength. " +
    "The problem: at ~47x forward P/E the stock prices in near-perfect execution while Q1 tailwinds (spare LRUs, China pull-forward) are unlikely to repeat and FCF conversion is constrained by inventory build + rising capex. " +
    "If aero supercycle extends and margin leverage compounds at 18% EPS CAGR, this justifies the premium. If growth normalizes to 7% and P/E compresses to 22x, it's -35% from here. " +
    "~30% probability of 15%+ CAGR — great business, expensive entry.",
