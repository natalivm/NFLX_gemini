  strategicNarrative:
    "KKR is the instrument for playing private capital recovery — DE path $6.74 -> $8.16 -> $9.88 (~21% CAGR through 2028), with insurance accrued income as the hidden catalyst for 2027-28. " +
    "At ~15x 2026E DE, the stock is adequately valued: prob-weighted IRR ~12-13%, with stress test (0% growth post-2028, 15x) still yielding 8.8%. " +
    "The problem: RS 16 signals no institutional momentum, carry is deeply cyclical, and post-2028 execution is the key unknown — this is not a lifetime compounder. " +
    "If exit markets normalize and insurance/private wealth channels accelerate, IRR reaches 18%+. If carry stays depressed, it's 7% dead money with a soft moat. " +
    "30-35% probability of 15%+ CAGR — a cycle bet on capital markets recovery, not a structural compounder.",

    'Distributable earnings growth slows to about 6% per year after 2028. Exit markets stay weak and carried interest remains depressed. ' +

      'Solid but just under the 15% threshold. No heroic assumptions required — just normalization of capital markets.',

      'Distributable earnings grow at 16%+ annually post-2028, reaching over $13 per share by 2030. ' +
      'Returns reach roughly 18% annualized from current entry. Requires sustained AUM growth, exit market normalization, ' +
      'carry recovery, and insurance accrued income materializing — ambitious but supported by management visibility.',
