  strategicNarrative: "SMCI is a high-volume, low-margin AI server assembler riding the GPU infrastructure wave. Revenue is hypergrowth (~$40B FY26E) but gross margins sit at 6.4% with 63% single-client concentration. The bull case requires margin recovery to 8%+ and client diversification. Post-earnings verdict: revenue story strong, quality story weak. This is a controlled cyclical bet, not a compounder.",
