  strategicNarrative:
    "Amphenol is the premium connector play for AI infrastructure — IT Datacom now 36% of revenue, Q4 book-to-bill 1.31x, FY25 adj EPS +77%. " +
    "CCS acquisition extends the platform with ~$4.1B revenue. Quality anchors are real (diversified end-markets, 52% dividend raise, RS 91). " +
    "The problem: at 44x trailing P/E, a compression to historical 22x means ~50% haircut — premium justified only if AI-driven growth sustains 15%+ CAGR. " +
    "Pay-up-for-quality entry, not an asymmetric one.",

    'The AI cycle fades while automotive and industrial end-markets remain weak, compressing margins from 26% down to around 22%. ' +

      'At current entry price, this scenario results in meaningful negative returns.',
    'AI datacom demand sustains, margins hold steady near 26%, and the CCS acquisition integrates on schedule. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 10% annually with a moderate re-rating to 30x. ' +
      'A solid execution path, though returns from current valuation remain modest at under 2% annualized.',
