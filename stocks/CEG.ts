  strategicNarrative:
    "Q4/FY25 earnings confirmed: adj operating EPS $9.39 (+8.3% YoY), matching consensus. Nuclear capacity factor 96.8%. " +
    "But real FCF is only $1.29B (OCF $4.24B − CapEx $2.95B) → 1.2% FCF yield at $105B market cap — very thin for a power business. " +
    "Switched to EPS × P/E model since heavy CapEx (uprates, restarts, Calpine integration) temporarily depresses FCF while earnings power is clear. " +
    "Calpine acquisition now closed — 2026 is first full combined year. Data center strategy real: CyrusOne 760 MW, Microsoft Crane 20-yr PPA + $1B DOE loan guarantee. " +
    "Capacity prices repriced structurally ($51.89 → $179.79 Mid-Atlantic) — sustainability is the key question. " +
    "P(15% CAGR) tightened to 35–40% post-earnings. At 31× trailing / 25–26× forward, this is a premium cyclical with structural AI tailwind, not a cheap compounder. " +
    "March 31 Business & Earnings Outlook (first combined guidance) is the next major catalyst. RS 22 — tape not confirming.",
