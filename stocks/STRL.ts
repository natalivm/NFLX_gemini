  strategicNarrative:
    "Sterling is a best-in-class infrastructure compounder with a structural AI/data center tailwind — E-Infrastructure (53% of revenue) delivered 42% organic growth and 28.4% operating margins in Q3, " +
    "with the CEC electrical acquisition creating a unique site-dev + electrical bundle that's seeing 40% margin uplift in early integration. " +
    "$4B+ total visibility ($2.58B backlog +64% YoY, $3.44B combined +88%), 80%+ mission-critical mix, book-to-burn >1.2x, and customers pulling them into new geographies (Texas, others planned). " +
    "Data center revenue +125% YoY, e-commerce distribution backlog +150%, semiconductor megaprojects on the horizon for 2026-2027. " +
    "Transportation (27%) is underappreciated: margins expanded from 9.6% to 13.5-14% via mix shift to design-build, with 2 years of backlog ahead of IIJA expiry. " +
    "Building Solutions (20%) is soft near-term on housing affordability but positioned for share gains in Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix. " +
    "The risk: at ~18x adj. EPS, the stock is fairly valued for current execution — any deceleration in E-Infra or DC capex cycling down compresses the multiple. " +
    "Net cash balance sheet ($306M cash vs $295M debt) and strong FCF provide flexibility for continued M&A. " +
    "40-50% probability of 15%+ CAGR — the E-Infra cycle needs to extend, and CEC integration needs to deliver on combined offering synergies.",

  desc: [
    'Data center capex cycles down as hyperscalers digest capacity, slowing E-Infrastructure organic growth to low teens. ' +
      'CEC integration friction pressures combined margins — the 40% margin uplift from bundled services proves harder to replicate at scale. ' +
      'Semiconductor megaprojects slip further right. Transportation holds steady on IIJA backlog but reauthorization uncertainty weighs on new awards. ' +
      'Building Solutions remains soft with housing affordability unresolved. The market re-rates Sterling as an ordinary industrial at 18x. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 8% annually but multiple compression from current ~18x drives flat returns.',
    'E-Infrastructure growth continues in the mid-teens organically as data center demand extends and CEC cross-selling gains traction. ' +
      '$4B+ visibility converts on schedule — 80%+ mission-critical mix sustains 25%+ segment margins. ' +
      'Semiconductor megaprojects begin contributing in 2027. Transportation benefits from IIJA successor bill; margins hold at 13-14% on design-build mix. ' +
      'Building Solutions recovers modestly as mortgage rates ease. Net cash balance sheet funds 1-2 tuck-in acquisitions annually. ' +
      'Earnings compound at roughly 14% annually with stable multiple at 24x.',
    'AI data center supercycle extends through 2028+ — CEC electrical + site development bundle becomes the industry standard, ' +
      'pulling Sterling into new geographies (Texas, Southeast, Midwest). Project sizes continue scaling (2-2.5x) with increasing infrastructure complexity. ' +
      'Semiconductor megaprojects deploy in force in 2026-2027, adding a second growth vector. E-commerce distribution renaissance continues at +150% backlog pace. ' +
      'Transportation wins large design-build contracts ahead of reauthorization. ' +
      'Margins expand as E-Infra at scale (28%+ operating margin) drives mix higher. ' +
      'Earnings compound at roughly 18% annually with premium 30x multiple for execution and secular visibility.',

  thesis: [
    'E-Infrastructure is cyclical, not structural — data center capex will normalize as hyperscaler spending matures. ' +
      'CEC integration adds execution risk: $484M acquisition needs to deliver on the combined offering promise. ' +
      'At ~18x adj. EPS, any deceleration in the highest-margin segment triggers earnings miss + multiple compression. ' +
      'Building Solutions is a drag (mid-high single-digit decline). IIJA expiry in Sept 2026 creates Transportation uncertainty. ' +
      'Project management capacity is the admitted bottleneck — rapid scaling risks quality dilution.',
    'Sterling is a beat-and-raise compounder executing across the three biggest infrastructure themes — AI/data centers, reshoring, and transportation modernization. ' +
      'CEC creates a differentiated offering (site dev + electrical) that no competitor currently matches at scale. ' +
      'Backlog visibility is exceptional: $4B+ pool, 80%+ mission-critical, book-to-burn >1.2x. ' +
      'Net cash balance sheet provides M&A optionality. 47% adj. EPS growth in FY25 proves operating leverage. ' +
      'At 14% EPS CAGR and 24x exit, returns are solid from current ~18x entry, with optionality from new geographies and chip plants.',
    'Sterling as the undisputed E-Infrastructure platform: site development + electrical + underground utilities = full-service mission-critical partner. ' +
      'Data center project sizes are growing exponentially with increasing underground infrastructure complexity (duct banks, EV charging, power distribution). ' +
      'Geographic expansion (Texas now, 2-3 more markets planned) doubles the addressable market. ' +
      'Semiconductor fabs, e-commerce mega-distribution centers, and renewable energy create a multi-vector growth flywheel. ' +
      'Transportation margin transformation (9.6% → 14%+) is underappreciated. ' +
      'If the supercycle extends and CEC delivers, $15+ adj. EPS power by 2028 supports $400+ stock price.',
