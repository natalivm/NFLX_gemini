  strategicNarrative:
    "Construction Partners is a compounding-through-M&A infrastructure play — revenue +44% YoY, record EBITDA margins, $3.09B backlog with 80-85% coverage, and Road 2030 targeting >$6B revenue / 17% EBITDA margin (doubling the business). " +
    "M&A pipeline is 'most active in 25 years' with Houston platform build-out creating local operational moats via HMA vertical integration. " +
    "The problem: at ~44x forward P/E, the stock prices in near-perfect execution while organic growth floats quarterly (Q1 only 3.5% vs 7-8% guide) and operating leverage amplifies both ways. " +
    "If infra cycle extends (Sunbelt + reshoring + data centers) and Road 2030 delivers, this looks like a compounder. If P/E compresses to 25x, it's -45% downside regardless of EPS growth. " +
    "40-50% probability of 15%+ CAGR — a bet on execution + infra cycle, not eternal moat.",

    'M&A integration stumbles or the infrastructure cycle turns. Award growth stalls and organic growth drops to 3-4%. ' +
      'Leverage stays elevated above 3x, limiting further acquisition capacity. EBITDA margins stagnate in the 14-15% range, ' +
      'falling short of Road 2030 targets. The market re-rates the stock as ordinary construction at 22-25x. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 10% but returns are negative to flat from current entry. In a stress scenario, downside reaches about 45%.',
    'Road 2030 is broadly on track with an active M&A pipeline, 7-8% organic growth, and backlog coverage above 80%. ' +
      'EBITDA margins reach the 15-16% range as fiscal 2026 guidance confirms. Leverage comes down to 2.5x by late 2026. ' +
      'Highway reauthorization provides five-year visibility for federal and state funding. The market values the business as a quality cyclical at 28-32x. ' +
      'Earnings compound at roughly 16% annually, though returns from current entry are modest at 1-3% annualized.',
    'An infrastructure supercycle unfolds driven by highway reauthorization, Sunbelt migration, reshoring, and data center commercial demand. ' +
      'The M&A pipeline is fully deployed with the Houston platform, greenfield plants, and geographic expansion all contributing. ' +
      'Road 2030 targets are achieved or exceeded with over $6B in revenue and 17% EBITDA margins. ' +
      'The market rewards execution with a 35-38x premium. Earnings compound at roughly 21% annually, ' +
      'delivering 9-12% annualized returns from current entry.',

  thesis: [
    'Cyclical downturn + valuation compression + M&A execution risk. No recurring revenue, operational moat only. ' +
      'At P/E 23x, downside is severe from current 44x forward. Leverage at 3.18x constrains flexibility. ' +
      'Organic growth volatile (Q1 only 3.5% vs 7-8% guide) — operating leverage cuts both ways. ' +
      'Infrastructure budgets are political: vulnerable to austerity, partisan shifts, reauthorization delays.',
    'Best-in-class cyclical operator with M&A compounding engine. Q1 FY26 confirms: +44% rev, +63% EBITDA, ' +
      'record margins, $3.09B backlog. Deleveraging on track. Road 2030 visibility is real. ' +
      'But 16% EPS CAGR at 44x entry = limited stock CAGR unless multiple holds above 30x. ' +
      'Needs either cheaper entry (~$85-95) or sustained bull conditions for 15%+ total return.',
    'ROAD as the Sunbelt infrastructure consolidator of choice. M&A pipeline "most active in 25 years", ' +
      'HMA vertical integration creates local moats, greenfield expansion adds capacity. ' +
      'Reauthorization + Sunbelt tailwinds + commercial (data centers, reshoring) provide multi-year demand floor. ' +
      'If Road 2030 delivers (>$6B rev, 17% margin, >$1B EBITDA), current valuation is justified and upside remains.',
