  strategicNarrative:
    "ASML is the highest-quality company in semiconductors — sole EUV supplier with a structural monopoly that's deepening (High-NA, multi-beam inspection, installed base upgrades). " +
    "Record Q4 bookings €13.2B, €38.8B backlog, AI-driven advanced node demand (4nm→2nm), and €12B buyback provide multi-year visibility. " +
    "The tension: at ~42x forward P/E, margin of safety is limited — 2026 mix headwinds (dry DUV, EUV 3600) create near-term noise even as 2027+ looks better. " +
    "Fundamentals = top tier. Valuation = not cheap. Cycle = decides everything. " +
    "55-65% probability of 15%+ CAGR — best entry on cyclical dips or P/E <30x.",

    'Capital spending pauses at TSMC and Intel as fab readiness delays persist and AI capex moderates. ' +
      'Margin pressure from the dry DUV and EUV 3600 product mix does not resolve by 2027. ' +
      'Earnings grow at 10% annually but the multiple compresses to its historical floor of 25x. ' +
      'At current valuation this translates to only about 4% annualized returns — essentially dead money.',
    'A normal semiconductor cycle plays out with AI and datacenter demand sustaining EUV dominance. High-NA ramps on schedule. ' +
      'The installed base plus upgrades grow steadily, and the 2026 margin dip recovers by 2027 as the product mix improves. ' +
      'The 12 billion euro buyback program adds 1-2% to annual earnings growth through 2028. ' +
      'Earnings compound at 18% annually with a 30x exit multiple, delivering around 16% annualized returns.',
    'An AI capex supercycle drives massive advanced node buildout at 2nm and below, with High-NA fully adopted after Intel qualification. ' +
      'DRAM EUV intensity accelerates as memory markets tighten and single EUV exposures replace multi-pattern DUV. ' +
      'Metrology and inspection revenues grow significantly, and the buyback program accelerates earnings per share. ' +
      'Earnings compound at 22% annually with a 35x premium multiple, delivering roughly 24% annualized returns.',
