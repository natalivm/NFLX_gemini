  strategicNarrative:
    "PAAS is a leveraged bet on silver and gold prices — fully unhedged, maximum beta to metals, with record FCF $1.2B driven by price not structural margin expansion. " +
    "Juanicipio is a low-cost FCF engine and Escobal restart (+$0.8-1.3 EPS, ~$2B NPV at $32 silver) is real optionality, but operating leverage is brutal both ways: 10% revenue decline means 20-30% profit decline. " +
    "At current price, the market already prices high metals + partial Escobal optionality (EV ~$27B vs DCF ~$18-20B without Escobal). RS 97 confirms momentum, but for commodity stocks RS 95+ often precedes volatile phases. " +
    "If silver hits $40+, this is a 2.5-3x multi-bagger. If metals correct, the unhedged exposure amplifies downside to -50%. " +
    "30-40% probability of 15%+ CAGR — a macro/metals momentum bet, not execution or structural moat.",

  desc: [
    'Silver corrects to the $25-28 range. Operating leverage works in reverse as revenue drops 15-20% and operating income falls 30-50%. ' +
      'All-in sustaining cost margins compress, and free cash flow normalizes from the record $1.2B down to $300-400M. ' +
      'Juanicipio grades decline as expected and Escobal stays suspended. Being fully unhedged means maximum downside exposure, with the stock potentially losing roughly 50%.',
    'Silver stabilizes in the $30-32 range. Record free cash flow normalizes from $1.2B to around $900M as prices settle. ' +
      'Juanicipio continues contributing at declining grades, and Skarn Phase 1 launches with moderate value. Escobal remains optionality only. ' +
      'Silver production growth of 14% in 2026 supports near-term results before flattening out. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 8% annually, delivering 8-10% annualized stock returns.',
    'A silver bull market pushes prices to $35-40 or higher. The fully unhedged exposure amplifies gains across the portfolio. ' +
      'Juanicipio and Skarn deliver strong free cash flow, and a possible Escobal restart adds significant earnings uplift of 25-30%. ' +
      'Total free cash flow exceeds $2B at peak. Earnings compound at 18% annually, delivering 22-25% annualized returns. ' +
      'This is the 2.5-3x multi-bagger scenario.',

  thesis: [
    'Metals cycle reverses, operating leverage brutal on downside. Fully unhedged = maximum pain. ' +
      'Not a structural compounder — no moat, no recurring revenue, no pricing power outside commodity markets. ' +
      'RS 97 = late-phase momentum, typical of commodity stocks near cycle top.',
    'Normalized FCF ~$900M, moderate growth from Juanicipio/Skarn production, but entirely metal-price dependent. ' +
      'Company in sweet spot: high prices, growing production, low debt — but this is peak-cycle setup. ' +
      '8-10% CAGR insufficient for 15% hurdle rate without multiple expansion.',
    'Silver supercycle + Escobal restart + operating leverage = multi-bagger territory. ' +
      'At $40+ silver: Escobal DCF >$4B, consolidated FCF >$2B/yr, EPS >$7-8. ' +
      'PAAS becomes a FCF machine. But this requires macro tailwind, not company execution.',
