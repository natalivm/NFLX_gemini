  strategicNarrative: "Post-earnings upgrade: B-type business (cyclical growth with strong structural tailwind). Subscription ARR $1.35B (+34% YoY), NRR >120%, record FCF $77M/quarter. Platform expanding — security modules drive >40% NRR (was 32%), Identity ~$20M ARR in 3 quarters with 40% net-new customers. Cloud ARR ~87% of subscription (+53% YoY). Moat is platform-shaped: high switching costs (resilience + identity + telemetry), outcome-driven value prop (clean recovery + compliance + identity remediation), regulatory tailwind (DORA/NIS2/SEC disclosure). Not 'unique formula' — moat is in integrated execution. Stock hypersensitive to two variables: (1) ARR sustainability >20%, (2) market willingness to pay >25x FCF. Prob-weighted nominal CAGR ~14.5%, risk-adjusted ~11–12% after path risk (50% chance of early compression to ~$27). FY27 material rights headwind creates headline slowdown risk. RS 10 = no institutional momentum. Best entry likely after compression event. Bet on execution + cyber resilience structural trend; AI agents are optionality, not core thesis.",
