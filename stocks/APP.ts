  strategicNarrative:
    "AppLovin is the highest-margin ad-tech engine in the market — 84% EBITDA margin, 95% incremental flow-through, $4B FCF. " +
    "Post-earnings: CAC/LTV 30-day breakeven + self-serve GA 1H'26 + GenAI creative tools signal a scalable growth loop beyond gaming. " +
    "The problem: margin expansion is exhausted at 82-84% EBITDA, so from here growth = revenue growth, and RS 26 says institutions aren't buying yet. " +
    "If self-serve + e-comm broaden the advertiser base, this is a 15%+ compounder. If ad cycle breaks, the leverage that created 84% margins works in brutal reverse. " +
    "60-65% probability of 15%+ CAGR — strong execution story, cyclical and priced for it.",

    'Advertising budgets get cut and competition from Meta erodes market share. Revenue growth drops to the low teens. ' +
      'At 82-84% EBITDA margins, there is no room to expand so any revenue miss flows straight to the bottom line. ' +
      'The self-serve rollout disappoints and the e-commerce vertical fails to scale. The multiple compresses to 18x, leaving near-flat returns from current entry.',
    'Q1 guidance validates the sustained growth engine. Revenue compounds at roughly 18% with EBITDA margins holding above 80%. ' +
      'The self-serve platform drives advertiser broadening, with customer acquisition payback scaling efficiently. Buybacks add 1-2% annually. ' +
      'The P/E naturally compresses from 43x to 22x through earnings growth, meaning returns are driven by EPS expansion rather than multiple expansion. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 31% annually, delivering around 15% annualized stock returns.',
    'Self-serve, e-commerce, and GenAI creative tools unlock a meaningful expansion of the addressable market. Revenue sustains 25%+ growth. ' +
      'Advertiser diversity improves conversion rates significantly, and MAX becomes the default auction layer for mobile monetization. ' +
      'Massive free cash flow funds aggressive buybacks. The market re-rates the business from cyclical to structural, ' +
