  strategicNarrative: "Vistra represents a rare combination of deep value and secular AI growth. RS 32 reflects a ~25% correction from highs, creating a contrarian entry opportunity. 20-year Meta PPA de-risks nuclear cash flows. Institutional model indicates meaningful fair value gap as the market underestimates long-term FCF conversion and capital return capacity.",
