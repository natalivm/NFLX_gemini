  strategicNarrative:
    "EMCOR is a B+ quality cyclical grower with a confirmed productivity moat — FY2025 actuals: $16.99B revenue (+18.5%), $25.87 adj. EPS (+20%), record 9.4% operating margin. " +
    "RPOs hit a record $13.25B (+31% YoY, up from $10.1B), with network/communications alone at $4.46B (+60% YoY). " +
    "AI data centers carry a 1.5–2x mechanical scope multiplier vs. cloud-era builds — an underappreciated tailwind baked into mechanical RPOs. Revenue grew 2x faster than headcount in FY2025. " +
    "Management confirmed no change in hyperscaler CapEx plans and 2–3 year demand visibility. 2026 guided at $17.75–18.5B revenue, $27.25–29.25 EPS, 9.0–9.4% op. margins. " +
    "At $726 (down from prior $811 model price), prob-weighted CAGR improves to ~9.5% — getting more interesting but still below the 15% BUY hurdle. Base case target ~$1,143 (57% upside); bear floor ~$653 (10% downside). Entry zone for a high-confidence BUY: ~$560–665. Holding here is defensible; adding on weakness below $700 is rational.",

  desc: [
    'Data center demand drops sharply, cutting about 12% of revenue despite starting 2026 with record $13.25B RPOs. Variable union labor absorbs some of the pain, but margins drift down to the 8-8.5% range. ' +
      'The market re-rates EMCOR as an ordinary industrial at 18x. Earnings still grow at about 7% annually from the $25.87 FY2025 base, but multiple compression drives roughly -4% annualized stock returns. ' +
      'The downside is driven by valuation reset, not bankruptcy risk. Managed but painful.',
    'Data center demand normalizes but holds at healthy levels. Organic growth runs in the high-single to low-double digits, backed by confirmed productivity gains (revenue 2x headcount growth). ' +
      'Capital allocation balanced: M&A pipeline strong, 60% dividend increase, $500M incremental buyback. The market values EMCOR as a quality cyclical at 24x. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 13% annually from the $25.87 FY2025 base, delivering about 7% annualized stock returns. Good company, not cheap entry.',
    'The AI data center supercycle extends through 2031. The 1.5–2x mechanical scope multiplier on AI vs. cloud-era data centers drives disproportionate revenue growth in the Mechanical segment. ' +
      'Prefab/VDC/BIM productivity moat pushes margins toward 10%+. Acquisitions execute well from the strong M&A pipeline. The market pays a 28x premium for execution and visibility. ' +
      'Earnings compound at roughly 17% annually from the $25.87 FY2025 base, delivering about 14% annualized stock returns.',
