  strategicNarrative: "LATAM e-commerce and fintech compounder in deep margin-investment mode. FY25 EPS fell to $36.69 from FY24's $37.69 despite 39% revenue growth to $28.9B — three consecutive quarterly EPS misses. Q4'25 revenue beat ($8.8B vs $8.5B est.) but EPS missed again ($8.32 vs $9.30) as EBIT margin compressed to 10.1% vs 13.5% a year ago. Credit portfolio swelled to $12.5B, driving provisions higher. RS 22 reflects justified skepticism, but top-line acceleration (44% Q4 YoY) and infrastructure moat remain intact. Qualified buy for 3-5 year horizon investors willing to hold through the earnings trough.",
