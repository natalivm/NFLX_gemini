  strategicNarrative:
    "Uber is a global mobility + delivery platform with $43.5B revenue, 11% FCF margins, and the theoretical optionality of becoming the platform-as-a-service layer for autonomous vehicles. " +
    "The problem: RS 16 signals aggressive institutional rotation out as AV promise meets regulatory friction and Waymo/Tesla competition threatens the core ride-hailing moat. " +
    "If Uber becomes the demand aggregator for AVs (fleet management, routing, insurance, demand matching), the platform value compounds far beyond current pricing. If AVs disintermediate Uber, the moat erodes. " +
    "Heavy distribution phase — wait for RS recovery above 40 before building a position. The AV optionality is real but the tape says institutions aren't paying for it yet.",
