  strategicNarrative: "Q2 FY2026 beat (NGS ARR +33% to $6.3B, EPS $1.03 vs $0.94 est.), but FY2026 EPS guidance cut to $3.65–3.70 (from $3.80) on CyberArk + Chronosphere integration costs. CyberArk (closed Feb 11) adds Identity as 4th pillar. 1,550 platformized customers, 119% NRR, SASE ARR >$1.5B. Stock RS ~20 — tape is broken. Avoid until integration costs digest and RS recovers above 40.",
