  strategicNarrative:
    "Post Q4'25 call (Feb 11 2026): Type B cyclical growth with execution-driven margin upside, not a structural compounder. " +
    "FY25 actuals: Rev $13.2B (+12.5%, +3.9% organic), Adj EBITDA $881M (+8%), Adj EPS $2.51. " +
    "2026 guidance: Adj EPS $2.85–$3.15 (+20% mid), EBITDA $930–970M, organic rev 4–5%, EBITDA→FCF conversion 30–40%. " +
    "Key: guidance assumes flat volumes — conservative; upside if cycle recovers. " +
    "Locked-in incremental revenue $774M (~6% gross growth), pipeline $2.5B. New business wins $1.1B in 2025. " +
    "Wincanton synergy: ~$20M YoY benefit in 2026, $60M run-rate by end-2026/into 2027. " +
    "Buybacks: $200M in H1'25 at avg $37.34 — normal capital allocation, not the EPS story. " +
    "Moat: moderate/operational (long contracts, switching costs, scale + automation) but no pricing power vs DHL/DSV/Kuehne+Nagel. " +
    "At $65.6 stock trades near bull fair value on 2026E ($69), not base ($57). " +
    "Entry zones: ideal $50–56, normal $56–60. Hold $60–75. Trim $70–75, hard trim $80+. " +
    "12–18mo targets via 2027E EPS $3.47: Bear $55, Base $62–70, Bull $76. " +
    "Probability of 15%+ CAGR: ~35–45% (improved post-call with guidance clarity + synergy runway). " +
    "Thesis: execution + margin expansion + Wincanton synergy. Not a secular megatrend bet.",
