  strategicNarrative:
    "GXO is a cyclical logistics operator playing an execution + margin expansion story — not a secular megatrend bet. " +
    "FY26 guide: adj EPS +20% mid ($2.85-$3.15), organic 4-5% on flat volume assumptions (conservative), Wincanton synergy ramping to $60M run-rate by end-2026. " +
    "The problem: at $65.6 the stock trades near bull fair value ($69), not base ($57) — pricing in execution that hasn't fully materialized yet. " +
    "If Wincanton synergies deliver + cycle recovers + margin expands toward 5% EBIT, this is a 15%+ compounder. If volumes stay flat, it's 8% dead money with no pricing power vs DHL/DSV. " +
    "35-45% probability of 15%+ CAGR — ideal entry $50-56 where risk/reward flips.",

    'Volume pressure persists with a slow new business ramp and retention challenges. Margins remain stuck around 4% EBIT. ' +
      'Earnings grow at only 5% annually and the multiple compresses to 16x, its historical stress zone. Essentially dead money from current entry.',
    'Guidance-level execution plays out with 4-5% organic growth and margin expansion toward 5% EBIT, driven by Wincanton synergies and productivity improvements. ' +
      'Earnings grow at roughly 11% annually with a 19x exit multiple. Returns come in around 8% annualized — decent but below the 15% hurdle without multiple expansion.',
    'Full execution across the board: margin catch-up, $60M in Wincanton synergies, strong pipeline conversion, and a cyclical recovery. ' +
      'Earnings compound at 16% annually with the market maintaining a 22x multiple on improved profitability. ' +
      'Delivers roughly 16% annualized returns, but requires strong execution and a normal macro environment.',
